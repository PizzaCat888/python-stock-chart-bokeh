1. Install python 3 if you have not done so already
2. download file to directory where python is enabled(I recommend enabling python for all paths)
3. In terminal, run python <<scriptnamegoeshere.py>> to see example
4. adjust script to see different results, such as the start and end dates, 
   a different company, a different source(I'm using Yahoo, but google works as well for example)
